## Javascript Implementation of the RSA Algorithm

This repository contains the complete Javascript implementation of the RSA Algorithm, including a implementation of the BigInteger library (called SuperInteger), and a web interface to generate the keys and encrypt/decrypt texts.

## TODO

- Optimize the SuperInteger operations to allow RSA to run with more than 64 bits on a reasable time.
